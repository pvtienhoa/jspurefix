In the case of the       *\r\n* InstrumentLeg component block it describes a security used   *\r\n* in multileg-oriented messages.                               *\r\n*                                                              *\r\n* Refer to the Instrument component block comments as this     *\r\n* component block mirrors Instrument, except for the noted     *\r\n* fields.                                                      *\r\n*                                                              *\r\n* Several multileg-oriented messages specify an Instrument Leg *\r\n* component block. An instrument can have zero or more         *\r\n* instrument legs. The fundamental business rule that applies  *\r\n* to the multileg instrument is that the multileg instrument   *\r\n* is defined as the combination of instrument legs. The        *\r\n* multileg instrument must be able to be traded atomically \u0013   *\r\n* that all instrument legs are traded or none are traded.      *\r\n*                                                              *\r\n* The LegRatioQty[623] is used to define the quantity of the   *\r\n* leg that makes up a single unit of the multleg instrument.   *\r\n* An option butterfly strategy is made up of three option      *\r\n* legs.                                                        *\r\n****************************************************************\r\n*/\r\nexport interface IInstrumentLeg {\r\n}\r\n"]}
